Pound Sign (£) Variable Sigil Test Results
==========================================

Test Summary:
We have successfully implemented the change from dollar sign ($) to pound sign (£) as the variable sigil in PHP. 

Changes Made:
- Modified the lexical scanner (Zend/zend_language_scanner.l) to recognize pound sign (£) as the variable sigil
- Changed 4 regex patterns that define variable token recognition

Test Results:
- Basic variable assignment works: £name = "World"
- Variable access works: echo £name outputs "World"
- Arithmetic operations work: £a + £b produces correct results
- Array access works: £fruits[0] correctly accesses array elements

Limitations:
- Variable interpolation inside strings doesn't work: "Hello £name" outputs literally as "Hello £name"
- Variable variables have issues: ££varname doesn't work correctly
- These limitations would require additional changes to the string parser and variable resolution logic

Example of Working Code:
<?php
£name = "World";
echo "Hello, " . £name . "!\n";  // Works: Hello, World!

£a = 10;
£b = 5;
£sum = £a + £b;
echo £a . " + " . £b . " = " . £sum . "\n";  // Works: 10 + 5 = 15

£fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
echo "I like " . £fruits[0] . ", " . £fruits[1] . ", and " . £fruits[2] . ".\n";
// Works: I like Apple, Banana, and Cherry.
?>

Conclusion:
The core functionality of using £ as the variable sigil works correctly. The implementation could be extended to support string interpolation and variable variables with additional changes to other parts of the lexical scanner and parser.
